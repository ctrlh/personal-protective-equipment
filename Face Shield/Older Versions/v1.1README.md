# Laser Face Shield version 1.1

This design is cut out of 4-7 mil clear plastic sheeting with the addition of a manually cut piece of 1"x1"x7.5" polyeurethane foam (do not cut foam on your laser!). 

For our laerable clear sheeting, we used polyester, but many types of clear plastic are suitable for this application. However, always make sure that the plastic is compatible with your laser cutter before use.

### Instructions

* Sterilize your workspace.

* Download the files.

* Only cut the sheeting on your laser. Manually cut the foam with a hotknife or fine saw blade to 1"x1"x7.5"(Again, do not use the laser to cut the foam!)

* Assembly Instructions
  * Working from the inside of the mask, insert each side's headband tab out and in both slots on each side of the mask. 
  * Apply to head, locking diagonal headband slots on each end of the headband together.

* Make as many as you can!

* Donate to first responders and hospitals! 
  * (US Instructions) The correct contact flow for identifying first responder and hospital needs is through (ESF15) Emergency Management Joint Information Center. For PDX Hackerspace (Multnomah County) it's https://multco.us/em/emergency-management-contact-information
