# Origami Laser Face Shield version 1.7 with Elastic Strap Modification

This design is cut out of 5-20 mil rigid clear plastic sheeting and rubber or elastic bands to provide tension around the back of the head. 

For our laserable clear sheeting, we used polyester, but many types of clear plastic are suitable for this application (polyester/mylar, acetate, PET). However, always make sure that the plastic is compatible with your laser cutter before use.
