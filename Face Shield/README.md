# Laser and Vinyl Cutter Face Shield version 1.2

This design is cut out of 5-7 mil rigid clear plastic sheeting with the (optional) addition of a manually cut piece of 1"x1"x7.5" polyeurethane foam (do not cut foam on your laser!) and rubber or elastic bands to provide tension around the back of the head. 

For our laserable clear sheeting, we used polyester, but many types of clear plastic are suitable for this application. However, always make sure that the plastic is compatible with your laser cutter before use.

### Instructions

* Sanitize your workspace.

* Download the files.

* (OPTIONAL FOAM INSERT) Only cut the clear plastic sheeting on your laser. Manually cut the foam with a hotknife or fine saw blade to 1"x1"x7.5"(Again, do not use the laser to cut the foam!)

* Assembly Instructions
  * Working from the inside of the mask, insert each side's headband tab out and in both slots on each side of the mask. 
  * thread a looped piece of elastic or rubber bands through the hole on the inside of each headband end (thread loops from inside to outside) then wrap each side of the band around each hook.

* Make as many as you can!

* Donate to first responders and hospitals! 
  * (US Instructions) The correct contact flow for identifying first responder and hospital needs is through (ESF15) Emergency Management Joint Information Center. For PDX Hackerspace (Multnomah County) it's https://multco.us/em/emergency-management-contact-information
