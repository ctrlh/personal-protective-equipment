# MVMask version 6.0 Adult and Child

## Important! [Prerequisite information on face mask use here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html)

The MVMask fabric face mask is a pleated pocket design cut out of quilter's cotton with non-latex elastic bands or straps providing tension around the back of the neck and crown of the head. Mask construction information is detailed below.

### First Responders and Medical Professionals
* This face mask is not recommended for medical use and has not been scientifically tested. If you're in Portland and surrounding areas, please use [this link](https://multco.us/em/need-resources-multnomah-county-resource-request-form) to request fabric face masks from Multnomah County Emergency Management

### First Steps

* Start by cutting out 12"x14" rectangles of quilter's cotton or other suitable fabric, 1 rectangle per mask. 
  *Important: many synthetic fabrics are not suitable as they do not wick moisture, creating conditions that prolong the life of COVID-19. 
* LASER/DRAG CUTTER REQUIRED: This is not a scissor friendly pattern, but meant for hobbyists and makers with access to cnc laser and drag cutting machines.

## Steps
  1. Lay cut pattern flat on your ironing board. Iron out any large creases.  
  2. Fold in each tab so that they overlap the main rectangle by ~1/2", iron the tabs to keep them in place.
  3. Fold the bottom of the large rectangle up, in half, aligning with the top of the rectangle, then iron to keep in place. 
  4. Fold all layers on top down, aligning your fold parallel with the bottom tabs' top line, then iron to keep in place. 
  5. Fold the same layers back up, aligning your fold so that the top and bottom tabs are flush with eachother, then iron to keep in place.
  6. stitch each side of the mask as illustrated in image 6 above.
  7. feed your elastic through each of the tabs on each side and tie the ends together, forming a loop that goes through the mask.
  7b. if not using elastic, leave the ends untied, tying in place when the mask is worn.
  8. Once your filter material of choice is inserted fully into the mask's filter pocket (we 1/4 fold Scott's shop towels for ours), orient the mask correctly and apply as shown around your neck.
  9. Stretch the other end of the elastic across the crown of your head. and position without touching the front or inside of the mask. If the bottom or top of your mask is not hugging your face, retie your elastic tighter to acheive the necessary seal.

## Production Notes 

This model is designed for fast construction. It includes pinked edges, which means that these edges may begin to look frayed after a few wash cycles. This is intentional. In order to produce as many masks as possible as quickly as possible, the design requires simplicity. By not needing to hem the edges on each face mask created, we have cut down production time significantly, helping more people protect themselves faster. Please make sure to review the [Information Here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) BEFORE using any face mask.
